<h2>Project Leader </h2>
Rajasthan hackathon 2.0 project

<h1> Kalyan Yojana </h1>

<p> "kalyan yojana" is the project developed during the Rajasthan hackathon 2.0. The main idea behind this was to uplift the poor villagers 
of our country who suffers alot because of the high ranking corrupt officers and the government officials.</p>

<h2> Solution </h2>
<p> We developed a online portal for the poor villagers which can be accessed by the villagers through the emitra centres computers and there they
can file a complain against any corrupt official anonymously and without even registering with the help of the bhamasha card API of rajasthan state</p>
